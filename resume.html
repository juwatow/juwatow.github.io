              <h3>Scrum Master - Cloud Platform, <a href="https://www.caseware.com/">CaseWare International Inc.</a></h3>
              <p class="date">2021 - Present</p>
              <p>The Cloud Platform team consists of four squads all committed to creating a platform software, a set of core services that help internal and external developers in building a wide range of applications to automate tasks for accounting firms.
                My contribution is mainly around helping the team to continuously reflect on their implementation of different processes & methodologies like scrum, kanban and Extreme programming (XP).
                Some of my responsibilities:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Ensure squads are fully embracing inspection and adaptation in various agile rituals (sprint planning, daily standup, sprint review and retrospective)</li>
                <li>Encourage & support the team to continuously learn and improve agile & software engineering practices like user story mapping, swarming via pair/mob programming, feedback loops, continuous delivery, …</li>
                <li>Design, capture, help analyze team metrics and accomplishments (e.g. lead time, cycle time)</li>
                <li>Advise on/Experiment with ways to optimize a remote-first culture (how to achieve the right balance for synchronous and asynchronous communication?)</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Scrum Master - Cloud Engagements, <a href="https://www.caseware.com/">CaseWare International Inc.</a></h3>
              <p class="date">2019 - 2020</p>
              <p>Working with the Smart Engagement group (5 teams) to continuously uncover better ways of creating technology solutions to innovate the accounting, auditing and tax professions. Some of my responsibilities include:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Assisting the group with our release cycle of 10 weeks: from the readiness (backlog refinements, prioritization of features & technical improvements, design walkthroughs, technical discussions and planning), through the development & regression phase (help identify and escalate any impediment to achieve our goals, assist in incorporating the feedback loop) until the product increment is released.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Ensuring the three pillars of empiricism are constantly lived by teams: assist with tools and artifacts to maintain transparency (different jira boards - scrum & kanban -, dashboards, Structure plugin for Jira, Confluence, Slack, Miro), facilitate sessions to inspect and adapt (daily scrum, review & demo, retrospective).
                </li>
                <li>
                  Putting in place tools that aggregate different insights to help the teams/group making decisions based on data and become more productive (cycle time, flow efficiency, WIP, sprint burndown, …).
                </li>
                <li>
                  Promoting continuous learning and continuous improvements by encouraging conversations at different levels of the company, by facilitating a discussion forum focusing on our journey of achieving agility, by researching and suggesting learning platforms or resources based on the specific challenges faced by the group, skills people want to improve or goals they want to achieve (introduced practices like user stories mapping, mob pair/mob programming).
                </li>
                <li>
                  Facilitating agile-related onboarding sessions and coach new team members (permanent and co-ops: on average, 15 co-ops join us every year) and making sure the dynamic in the teams doesn't become an impediment to achieve their goals.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
